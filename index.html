  <h1> Memories <br/> of an interface </h1>
  <h2> Chi Pham X Nokia 3310 experience </h2>
  <p> Chi Pham is a 25 year old woman currently pursuing her masters in communication design at parsons school of design, New York. She is originally from Vietnam but has been living in the states for a few years now. Earlier Chi was working as a technology consultant at EY but soon realised her calling for UI/UX design. This interview is all about her experience of a memorable interface - The Nokia 3310.</p>
<p> Upon asking Chi about a memorable interface, she remembered her first mobile phone experience a Nokia 3310 that was given to her by her parents. Although there were other mobile phones available at that time but her parents wanted her to make a practical use of it, hence a simple device. Her tech experience with the nokia was not ground-breaking as she knew about blackberry devices that were popular that year of 2006. Looking back she also remembers using her cordless landline device which was her only means of communication with friends and close friends. As all kids wish, Chi longed for privacy which a household landline couldn't provide. Getting a personal nokia device she could now have private conversations with her 7th grade boyfriend making her life less troublesome. Having a mobile phone she enjoyed texting and recalled how at that time there was a limit on daily text messages. It came as a surprise to her that the nokia 3310 model still exists and even got upgraded. She has some fond memories of the device as she remembered how the nokia survived every fall. Having a nokia she also mentioned the famous snake game which was a great pass time activity. </p>
<p> Concluding the interview she said nokia provided freedom, privacy and also opened her to similar technologies. </p>
